# FF Hub

A cool and free script hub for 1 game (for now) powered by Orion

# Loadstring:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ff-dev-team/ffhub/refs/heads/main/loader.lua"))()
```

The script will auto-detect the game you are playing right now. Use this script below to pick the right script for you game if you want:

```lua
getgenv().auto_pick = false
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ff-dev-team/ffhub/refs/heads/main/loader.lua"))()
```
